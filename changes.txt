easyrsa3-changes summary:

OpenSSL version 3 support:

This comes down to two changes:
- build-ca() had to have new openssl 3 code to build CA's.
  This code is only available to SSL v3 library not 1.x
  - Introduction of `$no_password`
    This sets either `-nodes` SSL-v1 or `-noenc` SSL-v3
    to build certificates without a password.

Level of change: Medium.
A lot of new code but only minor change to old code.
