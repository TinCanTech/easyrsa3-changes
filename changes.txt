========================================


OpenSSL version 3 support:

PR: https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/pull/492
This PR has good links to related commits and issues.

This comes down to two changes:
- build-ca() requires new openssl 3 code to build CA's.
  This code is only available to SSL v3 library not 1.x

- Introduction of `$no_password`
  This sets either `-nodes` SSL-v1 or `-noenc` SSL-v3
  to build certificates without a password.
  Effects all SSL libraries.

Level of change: Medium.
A lot of new code but only minor change to old code.

========================================


Support running 'easyrsa' from $PATH - #499 issue.

There are a lot of links on #499 to related changes and issues.

However, the core changes are as follows:

1.  Put 'easyrsa' in the $PATH. eg. '/usr/bin'
2.  Search defined locations:
    "$PWD"
		"${0%/*}"
		'/etc/easy-rsa'
		'/usr/share/easy-rsa'
		'/usr/local/share/easy-rsa'
    for:
    'openssl-easyrsa.cnf', 'vars.example' and 'x509-types'

3a.  If this is a new PKI then
     copy 'openssl-easyrsa.cnf' to the PKI
     and copy 'vars.example' to PKI
     and copy PKI/vars.example to PKI/vars
     and set $EASYRSA_EXT_DIR to the location of 'x509-types'
     and makesslsafeconf (Which basically tests the internals)

3b.  If this an existing PKI then
     copy 'openssl-easyrsa.cnf' to the PKI
     and copy 'vars.example' to PKI
     DO NOT copy PKI/vars.example to PKI/vars
     and set $EASYRSA_EXT_DIR to the location of 'x509-types'
     and makesslsafeconf (Which basically tests the internals)

This allows 'easyrsa' to be run from the $PATH and find all the
required files to operate.

It also promotes the use of the PKI folder for all data files
but does not make changes to currently functional PKIs.

These two changes are desired by easyrsa for future improvements.

Level of change: Medium.
A lot of new code but only effects new PKIs.

========================================


Use x509-types 'ca' and COMMON when building a CA

https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/pull/526

This uses the same awk script which inserts "Extra Extensions" into 
'openssl-easyrsa.cnf', to insert "x509-types/ca" and COMMON into the
config file, when building a CA.  Effects all new CAs but due to the
fact that the default settings in these files are all commented out,
this is a minor change.

Level of change: Low.
A little new code but only effects new CAs.
