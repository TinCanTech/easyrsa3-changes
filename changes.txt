OpenSSL version 3 support:

PR: https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/pull/492
This PR has good links to related commits and issues.

This comes down to two changes:
- build-ca() requires new openssl 3 code to build CA's.
  This code is only available to SSL v3 library not 1.x

- Introduction of `$no_password`
  This sets either `-nodes` SSL-v1 or `-noenc` SSL-v3
  to build certificates without a password.
  Effects all SSL libraries.

Level of change: Medium.
A lot of new code but only minor change to old code.

========================================


Support running 'easyrsa' from $PATH - #499 issue.

There are a lot of links on #499 to related changes and issues.

However, the core changes are as follows:

1.  Put 'easyrsa' in the $PATH. eg. '/usr/bin'
2.  Search defined locations:
    "$PWD"
		"${0%/*}"
		'/etc/easy-rsa'
		'/usr/share/easy-rsa'
		'/usr/local/share/easy-rsa'
    for:
    'openssl-easyrsa.cnf', 'vars.example' and 'x509-types'

3a.  If this is a new PKI then
     copy 'openssl-easyrsa.cnf' to the PKI
     and copy 'vars.example' to PKI
     and copy PKI/vars.example to PKI/vars
     and set $EASYRSA_EXT_DIR to the location of 'x509-types'
     and makesslsafeconf (Which basically tests the internals)

3b.  If this an existing PKI then
     copy 'openssl-easyrsa.cnf' to the PKI
     and copy 'vars.example' to PKI
     DO NOT copy PKI/vars.example to PKI/vars
     and set $EASYRSA_EXT_DIR to the location of 'x509-types'
     and makesslsafeconf (Which basically tests the internals)

This allows 'easyrsa' to be run from the $PATH and find all the
required files to operate.

It also promotes the use of the PKI folder for all data files
but does not make changes to currently functional PKIs.

These two changes are desired by easyrsa for future improvements.

Level of change: Medium.
A lot of new code but only effects new PKIs.

========================================


Introduce new vars_setup() regime #528

This allows running easyrsa from $PATH
and packaging data files elsewhere.

Basically, this change almost completely removes
the previous version of vars_setup().

See the PR for details.

Level of change: High.
A lot of new code and effects every use.

Note: I took great care to get this right.
Use of warnings not die for certain acceptable errors.
Partially replacating an init-pki for every command to
ensure that required files are Always found.
This also tests all "pre-flight" requirements before
launching what-ever command.

========================================


Disallow use of single quote (') in vars file #530

Two parts:
* Completely remove all (') from vars.example
* If vars is in the PKI then grep for single quote
  New PKIs will only have a (') if inserted by the user,
  if vars not in the PKI folder then do not check.

Level of change: Low.
Should not effect any old PKI. Only ever issues a warning.

========================================
 

Use x509-types 'ca' and COMMON when building a CA

https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/pull/526

This uses the same awk script which inserts "Extra Extensions" into 
'openssl-easyrsa.cnf', to insert "x509-types/ca" and COMMON into the
config file, when building a CA.  Effects all new CAs but due to the
fact that the default settings in these files are all commented out,
this is a minor change.

Level of change: Low.
A little new code but only effects new CAs.

========================================


Make gen_req() Always use EASYRSA_REQ_CN as intended

https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/pull/524

The PR is clear.

Level of change: Low.
A little new code but only effects new CAs.
